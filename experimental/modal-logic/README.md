# Modal Logic

Experiments about implementing modal logic in MeTTa, or perhaps should
I say *modal reasoning*.  Indeed, the idea I am trying to realize is
to be able to change the environment during reasoning, beyond the mere
monotonic addition of a variable declaration due to a lambda
abstraction.
